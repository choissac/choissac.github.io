Stereo and motion cues effect on depth perception of volumetric data

  Abstract                 = {
Displays supporting stereoscopic and head-coupled motion parallax can enhance human perception of containing 3D
surfaces and 3D networks but less for so volumetric data. Volumetric data is characterized by a heavy presence of
transparency, occlusion and highly ambiguous spatial structure. There are many different rendering and visualization
algorithms and interactive techniques that enhance perception of volume data and these techniques‟ effectiveness have
been evaluated. However, how VR display technologies affect perception of volume data is less well studied. Therefore,
we conduct two formal experiments on how various display conditions affect a participant‟s depth perception accuracy
of a volumetric dataset. Our results show effects of VR displays for human depth perception accuracy for volumetric
data. We discuss the implications of these finding for designing volumetric data visualization tools that use VR displays.
In addition, we compare our result to previous works on 3D networks and discuss possible reasons for and implications
of the different results.
