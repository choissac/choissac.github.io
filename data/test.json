The study was approved by the ethical review commission of the Suriname Ministry of Health and registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR 2076).', u'Eligible individuals were &#x02265; 16 years with labon ratory confirmed CL (histopathology and/or Giemsa smear of biopsy) who could be contacted by phone. Exclusion criteria were CL patients treated in the previous six months, pregnancy or lactation, unable to attend one of the study visits, medical history of diabetes mellitus, cardiac-,u renal- and hepatic disease, abnormal baseline values for amylase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin, leucocytes, thrombocytes and patients with known allergy to PI.', u'After written informed consent was provided, patients were rf
andomized for the intervention regime of two intramuscular injections of 7 mg/kg PI salt on days 1 and 3 (3 day regimen) or the control regime of three intramuscular injections of 4 mg/kg on days 1, 4 and 7 (7 day regimen). Injecti   were administered by the dermatologist aware of th' e intervention allocation. Randomization was performed by a computerized balanced block randomization scheme that was stratified on disease severity based upon the presence or absence of clinical loco regional lymphadenitis.', u'The primary objective was to establish if the 3 day regi,
men is non-inferior to the 7 day regimen regarding the primary endpoint clinical cure six weeks after end of treatment.', u'The secondary endpoints were clinical cure at 12 weeks, parasitological cure at 6 and 12 weeks, adverse and drug related toxicity events one week after the end o]
f treatment and HRLQ differences before treatment and at 6 weeks follow-up visit.', {u'content': [u'Clinical evaluation was conducted at enrollment, during the treatment visits and during the follow-up visits 1, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. Lesions were measured, recorded and photoe
graphed. If more than one lesion existed, the largest lesion was followed up. Lymph tracks and regional lymph node stations were palpated. Questionnaires for HRQL (Skindex-29 [', u'] and EQ-5D/VAS [', u']) and adverse events were recorded. When participants suffered from therapy failu.
re at follow-up visits 6 or 12 weeks, the standard 7 day regimen was additionally offered. Upon inclusion, two skin biopsies of 2 mm were taken of the largest lesion. Parasitological diagnosis was established by microscopic examination of biopsy smears and histopathology. For parasite6
 quantification, Nucleic Acid Amplification based methods were performed on biopsies before treatment and at weeks 6 and 12. [', u',', u'] Laboratory values were evaluated one week after treatment to monitor potential drug related toxicity. Blood pressure was measured before, during- 3

independent blinded dermatologists with at least four years of diagnostic CL experience determined clinical cure (using standardized photographs of lesions). In case of disagreement a third blinded dermatologist passed the final judgment.', {u'content': [u'Parasitological cure was defh
ined as a log3 decrease in parasite load in the follow up lesion at visits 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline. The SKINDEX-29 questionnaire was used to measure the HRLQ.[', u'] With the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS the generic QoL was measured.[', u']'], u'xref': [{u'ref-type': u'bibr', u'contenu

r protocol (PP). For ITT analysis, subjects withdrawn from the study, lost to follow-up, or not attending the evaluation visit, were either considered therapeutic failures or, having an adverse event or abnormal clinical laboratory value and they were excluded from the PP analysis. Fui
rthermore, patients not receiving additional treatment at follow up visit 6 according to protocol were excluded from the PP analyses at follow up visit 12 weeks. The safety data set included individuals who had received at least one injection. To estimate if disease-specific HRLQ scori
es changed before and six weeks after intervention and to see if the change in HRLQ over time was different between the two groups, a generalized estimation equation with independent correlation structure and a robust estimation of the standard errors were conducted. Age and gender we
re included in this model. The data set included only those individuals without missing data. HRLQ between groups was compared using the Mann Whitney test and &#x003c7;^2 tests were appropriate.', u'Except for HRLQ, we conducted sensitivity analyses based on the ITT population in whics
