HyFinBall: a two-handed, hybrid 2D/3D desktop VR interface for multi-dimensional visualization

  Abstract                 = {
This paper presents the concept, working prototype and design space of a two-handed, hybrid spatial user interface for minimally immersive desktop VR targeted at multi-dimensional visualizations. The user interface supports dual button balls (6DOF isotonic controllers with multiple buttons) which automatically switch between 6DOF mode (xyz + yaw,pitch,roll) and planar-3DOF mode (xy + yaw) upon contacting the desktop. The mode switch automatically switches a button ball’s visual representation between a 3D cursor and a mouse-like 2D cursor while also switching the available user interaction techniques (ITs) between 3D and 2D ITs. Further, the small form factor of the button ball allows the user to engage in 2D multi-touch or 3D gestures without releasing and re-acquiring the device. We call the device and hybrid interface the HyFinBall interface which is an abbreviation for ‘Hybrid Finger Ball.’ We describe the user interface (hardware and software), the design space, as well as preliminary results of a formal user study. This is done in the context of a rich, visual analytics interface containing coordinated views with 2D and 3D visualizations and interactions
